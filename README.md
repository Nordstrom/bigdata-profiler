# Bigdata profiler

This is a tool to profile your incoming data, check if it adheres to registered schema and do custom data quality checks. At the end of all this, a human readable report it autogenerated that can be send over to stakeholders. 

## Contents

* Datavalidator [notebook tool](data-validator.ipynb)
* Sample dataset [dataset](generated.json)
* Sample [result report](output/data-validator.ipynb)
* [Runner script](papermill_notebook_runner.py)

## Run Instructions

```bash
python papermill_notebook_runner.py data-validator.ipynb output/data-validator.ipynb '{"dataFormat":"json","inputDataLocation":"s3a://bucket/prefix/generated.json","appName":"cust-profile-data-validation","schemaRepoUrl":"http://schemarepohostaddress","scheRepoSubjectName":"cust-profile","schemaVersionId":"0","customQ1":"select CAST(count(_id) - count(distinct _id) as Long) as diff from dataset","customQ1ResultThreshold":0,"customQ1Operator":"=","customQ2":"select CAST(length(phone) as Long) from dataset","customQ2ResultThreshold":17,"customQ2Operator":"=","customQ3":"select CAST(count(distinct gender) as Long) from dataset","customQ3ResultThreshold":3,"customQ3Operator":"<="}'
```

## Install Instructions

There are several pieces involved. 

* First install jupyter notebooks. Install instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
* Next install spark magic. Install instructions [here](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/sparkmagic)
* Configure sparkmagic with your own Apache Livy endpoints. Config file should look like [this](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/sparkmagic/blob/634ee0d356b8e9685fe006739b7543149cfef374/sparkmagic/example_config.json)
* Install papermill from source after adding spark-magic kernels.Clone papermill project from [here](https://github.com/nteract/papermill). 
* Update the [translators file](https://github.com/nteract/papermill/blob/master/papermill/translators.py) to add sparkmagic kernels at the very end of the file. 

```python
papermill_translators.register("sparkkernel", ScalaTranslator)
papermill_translators.register("pysparkkernel", PythonTranslator)
papermill_translators.register("sparkrkernel", RTranslator)
```

* Next install schema repo. Install instructions [here](https://github.com/schema-repo/schema-repo).

That should be it.
